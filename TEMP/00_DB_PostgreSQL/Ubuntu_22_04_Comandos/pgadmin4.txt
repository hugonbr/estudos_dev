Just for reference: I ran into the same issue on ubuntu-20.04 running postgresql-13.1. To solve it with this configuration I had to run the following commands in the terminal:

sudo su postgres
psql
\password postgres
enter your password twice
Afterwards, I could log in through pgAdmin4 as usual, providing the set password.
